title: New site with Hugo and Netlify Continuous Integration

This site is built using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) static hosting with continuous integration powered by NodeJS and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Most content (blogs, pages) live in markdown files that are easily edited through [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms).

I chose this stack with page load speed in mind looking at the newest [JamStack](http://jamstack.org/best-practices/) best practices. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is completely free. The only thing I pay for is the domain. Every time I upload a change to GitHub, or the CMS does, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) works on a build that is done within a few minutes and could be even faster with some tweaking.

I'm using [FastHub] (https://github.com/k0shk0sh/Fast hub) to edit my posts on Android with SwiftKey as my keyboard resized to the smallest setting so it doesn't cover the code editor. Probably wouldn't be a problem on a larger phone like the Pixel 2 XL I'm getting soon. 

You can check out the [source](https://github.com/chrishutchison9/chrishutchison.me) of my site at GitHub and [deploy your own Netlify powered site with the click of a button](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo).
