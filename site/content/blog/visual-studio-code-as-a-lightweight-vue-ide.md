I'm really digging [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a lightweight Vue editor. I love PHPStorm but it was becoming a memory hog on my Ubuntu System. The default color scheme looks great as well. Check it out!

Another close tie would be [Atom] (https://github.com/atom). It truly lived up to it's name of being the hackable editor by allowing me to customize one of it's plug-ins. I got annoyed with entering a commit message on every git push so I customized it to stage files, put a default commit message, and push with the click of the button (tsk tsk, I know).
